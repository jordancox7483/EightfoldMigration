# Eightfold Migration Helper UI

The repository now includes a Tkinter-based desktop front-end (`migration_gui.py`)
that orchestrates the existing migration utilities. You can launch it directly
with Python or freeze it into a standalone executable for teammates that do not
have Python installed.

> **Executable availability:** Each release publishes `EightfoldMigrationHelper.exe`
> for Windows. It is intended for personal/internal use, considered alpha
> quality, and may not cover every edge case. If the UI misbehaves, re-run the
> underlying Python scripts directly.

## Prerequisites

| Purpose | Command |
| ------- | ------- |
| Base environment | `python -m venv .venv` (optional) |
| Activate on Windows | `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| Install dependencies | `pip install -r test/requirements.txt playwright pyinstaller` |
| Download Playwright Chromium | `python -m playwright install chromium` |

> **Note:** Before building an executable, set the environment variable
> `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=playwright-browsers` (or run
> `scripts\build_executable.ps1`, which does this automatically) so the browser
> binaries are packaged alongside the app.

## Launching the UI from source

```powershell
cd EightfoldMigration
python migration_gui.py
```

The window provides six groups of inputs:

1. **Core JSON Inputs** – Select the source/target form and question exports and
   the target configuration JSON you want to audit/update.
2. **Custom Fields Scraper** – Supply the Eightfold custom fields URL, plus the
   username/password used to sign in. Choose an output folder and filename for
   the CSV export (default `source.csv`), then click **Run custom_fields_scraper.py**.
   Run the scraper twice: first against the source environment (save as
   `source.csv`), then against the target environment (save as `target.csv`).
   The script runs in headless mode and writes the CSV to the folder you select.
3. **Custom Field CSV Selection** – Point the UI at the *source* (`source.csv`)
   and *target* (`target.csv`) CSV files generated by the scraper (or any existing
   CSV exports in the same format).
4. **Updated Form/Question Libraries** – Choose an output folder and click
  **Generate updated form & question libraries**. The tool runs
  `form_and_question_id_updater.py` (dry run) to validate mappings and
  `dependency_question_id_updater.py` to write prefixed copies of the target
  forms/questions into the chosen directory.
5. **JSON Rewriter** – Pick an output folder and click **Update selected JSON…**
   to copy the selected configuration JSON, apply the ID mapping pass, and then
   rewrite any `custom_field_id` values using the selected CSVs. The output file
   is named `Updated_<original>.json`.
6. **Admin Config Scrape** - Provide the admin console start URL (default `https://app-wu.eightfold.ai/integrations`), pick an output folder for JSON exports, and use:
   - **Run config discovery** to build/update `config_json_targets.json` next to
     the app config file. This can take a while and only needs to be run the
     first time (or when new admin pages are added).
   - **Run config export** to export all configs listed in the manifest into the
     output folder. The action reuses the username/password fields already shown
     under the Custom Fields Scraper section.


All actions emit progress and summary details in the log panel at the bottom of
the window. Each run is stateless—re-running the same action with new files will
only touch the selected inputs/outputs.

## Building a standalone executable (Windows)

1. Activate your virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies from the table above (PyInstaller + Playwright).
3. From the repository root run:

   ```powershell
   scripts\build_executable.ps1
   ```

   - If the Playwright browser bundle is missing, the script downloads Chromium
     into `playwright-browsers/`.
   - PyInstaller emits `dist\EightfoldMigrationHelper.exe`.

4. Copy the executable **and** the `playwright-browsers` folder to the target
   machine. No other installation steps are required.

You can customise the output name:

```powershell
scripts\build_executable.ps1 -Name MigrationUtility
```

## Running the packaged executable

Place the executable next to the `playwright-browsers` directory and double-
click it. The UI mirrors the Python version. All paths you select within the UI
are fully portable; no state is stored between runs.

If the scraper is unable to start because Chromium is missing, verify that the
`playwright-browsers` directory is present beside the executable. You can
rebuild the bundle at any time by re-running the steps in the previous section.
